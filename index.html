<h1>About this page </h1>
<p>This page is a blend of my photography and quotes that resonate with me; little sparks meant to brighten the day. Maybe you've been staring at a blank page, feeling unmotivated or putting off a project you care about. I know that feeling too, and I hope these photo + quote pairs can give you a nudge of inspiration. Wheter you're an artist, a student, or just someone who needs a reminder to pause and breathe, this space is here to help you reset and find a bit of momentum.</p>
<h2>One photo I shot + one line I love. </h2>
<p>Original photos with hand-picked quotes to inspire you. </p>
